    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> December 9, 2025</p>
    <p>This privacy policy governs the Home Assistant Alexa Skill integration for personal use. It describes how data is handled during account linking and smart home control.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account Linking Data:</strong> User ID and basic profile info (e.g., email) from Amazon to link your Alexa account to Home Assistant. This is used solely for authentication.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Home Data:</strong> Commands and status for exposed entities (e.g., lights, switches) in Home Assistant. No personal data is stored beyond what's needed for device control.</li>
        <li><strong>No Additional Collection:</strong> No voice recordings, locations, or unrelated data is collected. All processing happens on your local Home Assistant instance.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
    <p>Data is used only to enable voice control of your Home Assistant devices via Alexa. It is not shared with third parties.</p>
    
    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Your data is protected via HTTPS and OAuth. Access can be revoked anytime in the Alexa app or Amazon account settings.</p>
    
    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You can unlink accounts in the Alexa app (More > Skills & Games > [Your Skill] > Settings > Disconnect). Contact Amazon support for data deletion requests.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>This policy may be updated; check back for changes.</p>
    
    <p>For questions, refer to Home Assistant's <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/privacy/">official privacy policy</a> or Amazon's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GX7NJQ4ZB8MHFRNJ">privacy notice</a>.</p>
